The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAE1 gene\n   encodes a mitochondrial malic enzyme whose proposed physiological roles\n   are related to the oxidative, malate-decarboxylating reaction. Hitherto,\n   the inability of pyruvate carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae\n   strains to grow on glucose suggested that Mae1p cannot act as a\n   pyruvate-carboxylating, anaplerotic enzyme. In this study, relocation of\n   malic enzyme to the cytosol and creation of thermodynamically favorable\n   conditions for pyruvate carboxylation by metabolic engineering, process\n   design, and adaptive evolution, enabled malic enzyme to act as the sole\n   anaplerotic enzyme in S. cerevisiae. The Escherichia coli NADH-dependent\n   sfcA malic enzyme was expressed in a Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae background.\n   When PDC2, a transcriptional regulator of pyruvate decarboxylase genes,\n   was deleted to increase intracellular pyruvate levels and cells were\n   grown under a CO(2) atmosphere to favor carboxylation, adaptive\n   evolution yielded a strain that grew on glucose (specific growth rate,\n   0.06 +/- 0.01 h(-1)). Growth of the evolved strain was enabled by a\n   single point mutation (Asp336Gly) that switched the cofactor preference\n   of E. coli malic enzyme from NADH to NADPH. Consistently, cytosolic\n   relocalization of the native Mae1p, which can use both NADH and NADPH,\n   in a pyc1,2 Delta pdc2 Delta strain grown under a CO(2) atmosphere, also\n   enabled slow-growth on glucose. Although growth rates of these strains\n   are still low, the higher ATP efficiency of carboxylation via malic\n   enzyme, compared to the pyruvate carboxylase pathway, may contribute to\n   metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for anaerobic, high-yield\n   C(4)-dicarboxylic acid production.\nTC 0\nZ9 0\nSN 0099-2240\nUT WOS:000286597100004\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Zelle, Rintze M.\n   Trueheart, Josh\n   Harrison, Jacob C.\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J.

Pyruvate\n   carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae strains cannot grow on\n   glucose unless media are supplemented with C(4) compounds, such as\n   aspartic acid. In several succinate-producing prokaryotes,\n   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) fulfills this anaplerotic\n   role. However, the S. cerevisiae PEPCK encoded by PCK1 is repressed by\n   glucose and is considered to have a purely decarboxylating and\n   gluconeogenic function. This study investigates whether and under which\n   conditions PEPCK can replace the anaplerotic function of pyruvate\n   carboxylase in S. cerevisiae. Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae strains\n   constitutively overexpressing the PEPCK either from S. cerevisiae or\n   from Actinobacillus succinogenes did not grow on glucose as the sole\n   carbon source. However, evolutionary engineering yielded mutants able to\n   grow on glucose as the sole carbon source at a maximum specific growth\n   rate of ca. 0.14 h(-1), one-half that of the (pyruvate\n   carboxylase-positive) reference strain grown under the same conditions.\n   Growth was dependent on high carbon dioxide concentrations, indicating\n   that the reaction catalyzed by PEPCK operates near thermodynamic\n   equilibrium. Analysis and reverse engineering of two independently\n   evolved strains showed that single point mutations in pyruvate kinase,\n   which competes with PEPCK for phosphoenolpyruvate, were sufficient to\n   enable the use of PEPCK as the sole anaplerotic enzyme. The PEPCK\n   reaction produces one ATP per carboxylation event, whereas the original\n   route through pyruvate kinase and pyruvate carboxylase is ATP neutral.\n   This increased ATP yield may prove crucial for engineering of efficient\n   and low-cost anaerobic production of C(4) dicarboxylic acids in S.\n   cerevisiae.\nTC 1\nZ9 1\nSN 0099-2240\nUT WOS:000280633400006\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Zelle, Rintze M.\n   De Hulster, Erik\n   Kloezen, Wendy\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J.

With\n   shake flasks, process parameters that are important for scaling up this\n   process cannot be controlled independently. In this study, growth and\n   product formation by the engineered strain were studied in bioreactors\n   in order to separately analyze the effects of pH, calcium, and carbon\n   dioxide and oxygen availability. A near-neutral pH, which in shake\n   flasks was achieved by adding CaCO(3), was required for efficient C(4)\n   dicarboxylic acid production. Increased calcium concentrations, a side\n   effect of CaCO(3) dissolution, had a small positive effect on malate\n   formation. Carbon dioxide enrichment of the sparging gas (up to 15%\n   [vol/vol]) improved production of both malate and succinate. At higher\n   concentrations, succinate titers further increased, reaching 0.29 mol\n   (mol glucose)(-1), whereas malate formation strongly decreased. Although\n   fully aerobic conditions could be achieved, it was found that moderate\n   oxygen limitation benefitted malate production. In conclusion, malic\n   acid production with the engineered S. cerevisiae strain could be\n   successfully transferred from shake flasks to 1-liter batch bioreactors\n   by simultaneous optimization of four process parameters (pH and\n   concentrations of CO(2), calcium, and O(2)). Under optimized conditions,\n   a malate yield of 0.48 +/- 0.01 mol (mol glucose)(-1) was obtained in\n   bioreactors, a 19% increase over yields in shake flask experiments.\nTC 2\nZ9 2\nSN 0099-2240\nUT WOS:000274017400015\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Abbott, Derek A.\n   Zelle, Rintze M.\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J.

Microbial conversion of\n   renewable feedstocks has a huge potential for cleaner, sustainable\n   industrial production of fuels and chemicals. Microbial production of\n   organic acids is a promising approach for production of chemical\n   building blocks that can replace their petrochemically derived\n   equivalents. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not naturally\n   produce organic acids in large quantities, its robustness, pH tolerance,\n   simple nutrient requirements and long history as an industrial workhorse\n   make it an excellent candidate biocatalyst for such processes. Genetic\n   engineering, along with evolution and selection, has been successfully\n   used to divert carbon from ethanol, the natural endproduct of S.\n   cerevisiae, to pyruvate. Further engineering, which included expression\n   of heterologous enzymes and transporters, yielded strains capable of\n   producing lactate and malate from pyruvate. Besides these metabolic\n   engineering strategies, this review discusses the impact of transport\n   and energetics as well as the tolerance towards these organic acids. In\n   addition to recent progress in engineering S. cerevisiae for organic\n   acid production, the key limitations and challenges are discussed in the\n   context of sustainable industrial production of organic acids from\n   renewable feedstocks.\nTC 11\nZ9 11\nSN 1567-1356\nUT WOS:000271264400001\nER\n\nPT J\nAU Zelle, Rintze M.\n   de Hulster, Erik\n   van Winden, WoUter A.\n   de Waard, Pieter\n   Dijkema, Cor\n   Winkler, Aaron A.\n   Geertman, Jan-Maarten A.\n   van Dijken, Johannes P.\n   Pronk, Jack T.\n   van Maris, Antonius J.

Since wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains\n   produce only low levels of malate, metabolic engineering is required to\n   achieve efficient malate production with this yeast. A promising pathway\n   for malate production from glucose proceeds via carboxylation of\n   pyruvate, followed by reduction of oxaloacetate to malate. This redox-\n   and ATP-neutral, CO2-fixing pathway has a theoretical maximum yield of 2\n   mol malate (mol glucose)(-1). A previously engineered glucose-tolerant,\n   C-2-independent pyruvate decarboxylase-negative S. cerevisiae strain was\n   used as the platform to evaluate the impact of individual and combined\n   introduction of three genetic modifications: (i) overexpression of the\n   native pyruvate carboxylase encoded by PYC2, (ii) high-level expression\n   of an allele of the MDH3 gene, of which the encoded malate dehydrogenase\n   was retargeted to the cytosol by deletion of the C-terminal peroxisomal\n   targeting sequence, and (iii) functional expression of the\n   Schizosaccharomyces pombe malate transporter gene SpMAE1. While single\n   or double modifications improved malate production, the highest malate\n   yields and titers were obtained with the simultaneous introduction of\n   all three modifications. In glucose-grown batch cultures, the resulting\n   engineered strain produced malate at titers of up to 59 g liter(-1) at a\n   malate yield of 0.42 mol (mol glucose)(-1). Metabolic flux analysis\n   showed that metabolite labeling patterns observed upon nuclear magnetic\n   resonance analyses of cultures grown on C-13-labeled glucose were\n   consistent with the envisaged nonoxidative, fermentative pathway for\n   malate production. The engineered strains still produced substantial\n   amounts of pyruvate, indicating that the pathway efficiency can be\n   further improved.\nTC 15\nZ9 17\nSN 0099-2240\nUT WOS:000255567900024\nER\n\nEF&quot;,

                &quot;abstractNote&quot;: &quot;Malic enzyme catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of   malate to pyruvate and CO(2). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAE1 gene   encodes a mitochondrial malic enzyme whose proposed physiological roles   are related to the oxidative, malate-decarboxylating reaction. Hitherto,   the inability of pyruvate carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae   strains to grow on glucose suggested that Mae1p cannot act as a   pyruvate-carboxylating, anaplerotic enzyme. In this study, relocation of   malic enzyme to the cytosol and creation of thermodynamically favorable   conditions for pyruvate carboxylation by metabolic engineering, process   design, and adaptive evolution, enabled malic enzyme to act as the sole   anaplerotic enzyme in S. cerevisiae. The Escherichia coli NADH-dependent   sfcA malic enzyme was expressed in a Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae background.   When PDC2, a transcriptional regulator of pyruvate decarboxylase genes,   was deleted to increase intracellular pyruvate levels and cells were   grown under a CO(2) atmosphere to favor carboxylation, adaptive   evolution yielded a strain that grew on glucose (specific growth rate,   0.06 +/- 0.01 h(-1)). Growth of the evolved strain was enabled by a   single point mutation (Asp336Gly) that switched the cofactor preference   of E. coli malic enzyme from NADH to NADPH. Consistently, cytosolic   relocalization of the native Mae1p, which can use both NADH and NADPH,   in a pyc1,2 Delta pdc2 Delta strain grown under a CO(2) atmosphere, also   enabled slow-growth on glucose. Although growth rates of these strains   are still low, the higher ATP efficiency of carboxylation via malic   enzyme, compared to the pyruvate carboxylase pathway, may contribute to   metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for anaerobic, high-yield   C(4)-dicarboxylic acid production.&quot;,

                &quot;abstractNote&quot;: &quot;Pyruvate carboxylase is the sole anaplerotic enzyme in glucose-grown   cultures of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pyruvate   carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae strains cannot grow on   glucose unless media are supplemented with C(4) compounds, such as   aspartic acid. In several succinate-producing prokaryotes,   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) fulfills this anaplerotic   role. However, the S. cerevisiae PEPCK encoded by PCK1 is repressed by   glucose and is considered to have a purely decarboxylating and   gluconeogenic function. This study investigates whether and under which   conditions PEPCK can replace the anaplerotic function of pyruvate   carboxylase in S. cerevisiae. Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae strains   constitutively overexpressing the PEPCK either from S. cerevisiae or   from Actinobacillus succinogenes did not grow on glucose as the sole   carbon source. However, evolutionary engineering yielded mutants able to   grow on glucose as the sole carbon source at a maximum specific growth   rate of ca. 0.14 h(-1), one-half that of the (pyruvate   carboxylase-positive) reference strain grown under the same conditions.   Growth was dependent on high carbon dioxide concentrations, indicating   that the reaction catalyzed by PEPCK operates near thermodynamic   equilibrium. Analysis and reverse engineering of two independently   evolved strains showed that single point mutations in pyruvate kinase,   which competes with PEPCK for phosphoenolpyruvate, were sufficient to   enable the use of PEPCK as the sole anaplerotic enzyme. The PEPCK   reaction produces one ATP per carboxylation event, whereas the original   route through pyruvate kinase and pyruvate carboxylase is ATP neutral.   This increased ATP yield may prove crucial for engineering of efficient   and low-cost anaerobic production of C(4) dicarboxylic acids in S.   cerevisiae.&quot;,

                &quot;abstractNote&quot;: &quot;A recent effort to improve malic acid production by Saccharomyces   cerevisiae by means of metabolic engineering resulted in a strain that   produced up to 59 g liter(-1) of malate at a yield of 0.42 mol (mol   glucose)(-1) in calcium carbonate-buffered shake flask cultures. With   shake flasks, process parameters that are important for scaling up this   process cannot be controlled independently. In this study, growth and   product formation by the engineered strain were studied in bioreactors   in order to separately analyze the effects of pH, calcium, and carbon   dioxide and oxygen availability. A near-neutral pH, which in shake   flasks was achieved by adding CaCO(3), was required for efficient C(4)   dicarboxylic acid production. Increased calcium concentrations, a side   effect of CaCO(3) dissolution, had a small positive effect on malate   formation. Carbon dioxide enrichment of the sparging gas (up to 15%   [vol/vol]) improved production of both malate and succinate. At higher   concentrations, succinate titers further increased, reaching 0.29 mol   (mol glucose)(-1), whereas malate formation strongly decreased. Although   fully aerobic conditions could be achieved, it was found that moderate   oxygen limitation benefitted malate production. In conclusion, malic   acid production with the engineered S. cerevisiae strain could be   successfully transferred from shake flasks to 1-liter batch bioreactors   by simultaneous optimization of four process parameters (pH and   concentrations of CO(2), calcium, and O(2)). Under optimized conditions,   a malate yield of 0.48 +/- 0.01 mol (mol glucose)(-1) was obtained in   bioreactors, a 19% increase over yields in shake flask experiments.&quot;,

                &quot;abstractNote&quot;: &quot;To meet the demands of future generations for chemicals and energy and   to reduce the environmental footprint of the chemical industry,   alternatives for petrochemistry are required. Microbial conversion of   renewable feedstocks has a huge potential for cleaner, sustainable   industrial production of fuels and chemicals. Microbial production of   organic acids is a promising approach for production of chemical   building blocks that can replace their petrochemically derived   equivalents. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not naturally   produce organic acids in large quantities, its robustness, pH tolerance,   simple nutrient requirements and long history as an industrial workhorse   make it an excellent candidate biocatalyst for such processes. Genetic   engineering, along with evolution and selection, has been successfully   used to divert carbon from ethanol, the natural endproduct of S.   cerevisiae, to pyruvate. Further engineering, which included expression   of heterologous enzymes and transporters, yielded strains capable of   producing lactate and malate from pyruvate. Besides these metabolic   engineering strategies, this review discusses the impact of transport   and energetics as well as the tolerance towards these organic acids. In   addition to recent progress in engineering S. cerevisiae for organic   acid production, the key limitations and challenges are discussed in the   context of sustainable industrial production of organic acids from   renewable feedstocks.&quot;,

                &quot;abstractNote&quot;: &quot;Malic acid is a potential biomass-derivable \&quot;building block\&quot; for   chemical synthesis. Since wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains   produce only low levels of malate, metabolic engineering is required to   achieve efficient malate production with this yeast. A promising pathway   for malate production from glucose proceeds via carboxylation of   pyruvate, followed by reduction of oxaloacetate to malate. This redox-   and ATP-neutral, CO2-fixing pathway has a theoretical maximum yield of 2   mol malate (mol glucose)(-1). A previously engineered glucose-tolerant,   C-2-independent pyruvate decarboxylase-negative S. cerevisiae strain was   used as the platform to evaluate the impact of individual and combined   introduction of three genetic modifications: (i) overexpression of the   native pyruvate carboxylase encoded by PYC2, (ii) high-level expression   of an allele of the MDH3 gene, of which the encoded malate dehydrogenase   was retargeted to the cytosol by deletion of the C-terminal peroxisomal   targeting sequence, and (iii) functional expression of the   Schizosaccharomyces pombe malate transporter gene SpMAE1. While single   or double modifications improved malate production, the highest malate   yields and titers were obtained with the simultaneous introduction of   all three modifications. In glucose-grown batch cultures, the resulting   engineered strain produced malate at titers of up to 59 g liter(-1) at a   malate yield of 0.42 mol (mol glucose)(-1). Metabolic flux analysis   showed that metabolite labeling patterns observed upon nuclear magnetic   resonance analyses of cultures grown on C-13-labeled glucose were   consistent with the envisaged nonoxidative, fermentative pathway for   malate production. The engineered strains still produced substantial   amounts of pyruvate, indicating that the pathway efficiency can be   further improved.&quot;,
